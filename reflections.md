#  REFLECTION.md – Assignment 15

This reflection documents my experience contributing to peer repositories during Assignment 15: Cross-Project Collaboration.

##  What I Learned

###  Collaborative Open Source
By working on peer projects, I learned how to respect another developer’s codebase, adhere to their contribution guidelines, and communicate effectively through issues and pull requests. Open-source collaboration helped sharpen my ability to read, understand, and modify unfamiliar code.

###  Revisions and Feedback
Receiving feedback on PRs taught me the importance of clarity in code and documentation. In one case, a reviewer suggested splitting a commit and improving the test description. This helped me improve my workflow and write cleaner commits in later PRs.

###  CI/CD Understanding
Each repository had its own GitHub Actions pipeline. I learned how CI failures are used as blockers for PRs and how code formatting, linting, and test execution are automated. This reinforced the importance of pipelines for code health.

##  Challenges Faced

- **Understanding Code Quickly**: It was challenging to step into someone else's project and make confident contributions without breaking existing functionality.
- **Staying Within Scope**: I had to resist the urge to fix unrelated issues and focus on solving just the ticketed bug or improvement.
- **Communicating with Peers**: Waiting for issue confirmations or reviews required patience and follow-up.

##  Broader Takeaways

- Open-source work strengthens your reading, testing, and communication skills.
- CI pipelines are powerful but unforgiving — one small mistake can block a merge.
- Small, focused contributions (e.g., test coverage, doc updates) are highly valued in peer projects.
